SkyStream: Zero-Build Aircraft Dashboard

A lightweight, aesthetically pleasing interactive dashboard that tracks global commercial aircraft orders and deliveries (Airbus, Boeing, Embraer).

Live Demo: [Insert your GitHub Pages URL here]

🚀 Features

Zero-Build Architecture: No npm install, no webpack, no node_modules. Runs entirely in the browser using React & Babel Standalone.

Serverless Backend: Uses GitHub Actions as a "backend" to run Python scripts.

Automated Data Pipeline: A daily cron job scrapes/generates data and commits it to the repository as data.json.

Interactive Visualizations: Built with Recharts for beautiful, responsive charts.

🛠 Architecture Overview

This project uses a unique "Flat Data" approach to avoid hosting costs and complex backends.

Frontend (index.html): A single HTML file containing the React application. It fetches data from a static ./data.json file relative to itself.

Backend (scraper.py): A Python script that scrapes Wikipedia (or generates mock data if parsing fails) and saves the result to data.json.

Automation (daily_scrape.yml): A GitHub Action that runs every 24 hours. It:

Sets up a Python environment.

Runs scraper.py.

Commits the updated data.json back to the repository.

GitHub Pages automatically serves the new file.

⚙️ Setup Guide

1. Clone & Configure

Simply upload the files to a new GitHub repository.

2. Activate Automation

Ensure your workflow file is located exactly at .github/workflows/daily_scrape.yml.

Go to the Actions tab in your repository.

Select Daily Aircraft Data Scrape on the left.

Click Run Workflow to generate the initial data.json file.

3. Deploy to GitHub Pages

Go to Settings > Pages.

Under Source, select Deploy from a branch.

Select your main branch and the / (root) folder.
